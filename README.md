## Introduction
This repository contains the analysis of FitBit Fitness Tracker data for Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. The aim of this analysis is to gain insights into trends related to the usage of non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply these insights to Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Ask Phase

### Business Task
The business task is to identify trends in the usage of non-Bellabeat smart devices and utilize these insights to enhance Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

### Key Stakeholders
Urška Sršen: Bellabeat's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer.

Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat co-founder; a key member of the Bellabeat executive team.

Bellabeat marketing analytics team: Data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Prepare Phase
### Data Sources Used
The data source used for this case study is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, available on Kaggle and provided through Mobius.

### Accessibility and Privacy of Data
The metadata of the dataset is open-source, allowing for copying, modification, and usage without permission.

### Data Organization and Verification
The dataset comprises 18 CSV documents, each representing different data tracked by Fitbit.

### Information about the Dataset
The dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID or timestamp. The variation between outputs represents the use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors/preferences.

## Process Phase
Due to the large volume of data, R programming language was used for data analysis, facilitating efficient data manipulation, visualization, and sharing of results with stakeholders.

## Analyze and Share Phase
In this phase, trends of FitBit users were analyzed to assist in determining Bellabeat's marketing strategy. The following analysis was performed:

1. Type of Users per Activity Level: Users were categorized based on their daily steps into the following classifications:

Sedentary: Less than 5,000 steps per day

Low Active: 5,000 to 7,499 steps per day

Average Active: 7,500 to 9,999 steps per day

Active: More than 10,000 steps per day

These classifications were determined using the article provided (https://greatist.com/health/how-many-steps-a-day#how-many-steps).

## Act Phase
Bellabeat provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data helps users understand their habits and make healthy decisions. Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided:

1. Notification on Steps Daily and Hourly: Users average around 7,500 steps per day, while the recommended daily steps are at least 8,000. It is recommended to send notifications to remind users to reach their daily step goal. Additionally, hourly notifications can be sent to encourage usersto move, explaining the importance of physical activity.
2. Fitness Tracking: There is a positive correlation between total steps and calories burned. Bellabeat can consider integrating features for tracking calories burned during different activities and workouts. Providing tables that display the calories burned for each activity and workout intensity can help users track their fitness progress.
3. Sleep Tracking: The analysis only provides information on the amount of sleep but not the quality and timing of sleep. It is recommended to incorporate sensors that can track sleep quality and provide insights on users' sleep patterns and optimal sleep times.

## Conclusion
This analysis of FitBit Fitness Tracker data offers valuable insights into trends related to the usage of non-Bellabeat smart devices. The recommendations provided aim to improve Bellabeat's marketing strategy by leveraging these insights. By implementing the suggested strategies, Bellabeat can enhance user engagement, promote physical activity, and provide users with a comprehensive health and wellness experience.
